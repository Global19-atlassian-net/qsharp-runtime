# Target Package Definitions

## Purpose

A target package is intended to provide the core functionality of the callables in the Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic namespase specialized to a particular hardware or software (simulator) target. Not every target natively supports the same set of callables, so the expected pattern for adapting them to the Q# API is via the package that defines the set of natively supported callabes (defined as `body intrinsic` in Q#) and the set of decompositions in Q# that implemenent the remainder of the API via the subset of native callables.

## Design

Each taret package is comprised of a subset of `body intrinsic` Q# definitions, drawn from the TargetDefinitions/Intrinsic folder, along with the necessary decomposition implementations from TargetDefinitions/Decompositions folder so sufficiently implement the remainder of the Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic API surface. Each intrinsic or decomposed callable is kept in a separate file to allow for easier reuse and recombination across packages. The individual package defines the subset files that should be compiled together into the package via a .props file in the TargetDefinitions/TargetPackages folder. That file acts as an easy reference for understanding which callabes are native to that target and which decompositions each target uses. As support for new targets is added, they can reuse existing intrinsic or decomposition definitions in a new combination and/or introduce new callables (some of which may be internal for use in decompositions only) that correspond to taret-specific capabilities. The goal for any target package is that each callabe that shares a name with a publicly defined API (such as `X` or `Measure`) will have the same signature and API contract even though the details of each implementaiton may vary. That way even if different targets have different capabilities, the core set of Q# gates functions the same across all targets (with allowances for increased complexity or resource utilization in a given decomposition).
